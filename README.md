3d printing files for the rosco_m68k homebuilt computer

Comments:
1. Files are subject to change at any time.
2. High precision is required for everything to fit.
3. I have found, with my 3d printers, that high plate temps are required to prevent curling.
4. However, high plate temp causes bleeding of the printing material.  Best of luck.
5. You will probably need to take an xacto knife or a box cutter to the tabs and the slots to do minute trimming.
6. It will be a very tight fit.  
7. Work each plate connection independently and get it fitted perfectly before you start the next one or mount anything.
8. Hope you like the results.

*.FCStd files are FreeCad editable
*.stl files are input files for the slicer

Prefixes:
fpr - front plate
lpr - left plate
rpr - right plate
bpr - back plate
tpr - top plate
bb - base board plate

All that said, these are free to use by anyone.

2021-09-21: Updated to modify the default fpr file to include holes for LEDs and added one for a reset switch.
        Added a second fpr version which did not include the reset switch (fprm68k-noresetswitch).
